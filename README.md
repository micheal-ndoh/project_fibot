# `PROJECT FIBOT`

**Description**

An action in GitHub written in Rust that scans the text of the pull request for numbers, calculates its Fibonacci number, and proceeds to post a comment with the results. The action has two parameters(e.g., a flag to enable Fibonacci calculation and a threshold limit).

## **Objectives / Milestiones / Key points**

> Here a the objectives and milestones that are covered in this projects

### Step 1. Printing and confirming from logs

- A Rust program that prints “Hello, world!” when executed.

  - A GitHub workflow that runs the “Hello, world!” program and outputs in the action logs.

  - A minimum working GitHub Action written in Rust that is running on GitHub correctly.

### Step 2: Workflows

- An action.yml workflow file that implements input parsing both on the rust side and on the action side and accepts parameters `enable_fib` and `max_threshold`.

### Step 3: Fibonacci function

- A rust basic level function with sample edge cases to test invoke the fibonacci function.

- Will have the main parts of extracting numbers and calling the fibonacci function embedded within the core logic.

### Step 4: Github API

- Integrated functionality that extracts numbers and computes their Fibonacci values.
- A rust code that posts a comment to a pull request GitHub API, which integrates authentication and the computed results.

### Step 5: Verifying and testing

- The action should be able to process the pull request, compute ,fibonacci numbers  for extracted values and post a comment with the results
- A fully functioning GitHub Action tested in a dummy repository, with successful execution on pull requests.

### Step 6: Display

- A comprehensive README with setup instructions, parameter configurations, and code comments; plus any necessary code refinements.
- A polished, documented, and fully working GitHub Action that is ready for public use.

## Usage

### The workflow runs on pull request so you will have to do the follow steps
1. Forked the repository and create a new branch then make some changes by adding numbers or a sentence containing numbers which will be extracted and the fibonacci frequency will be display on the comment section of the pull request and create a pull request.

2. **Inputs**:
   To set parameters edit the fibonacci `.github/workflows/fibbot.yml` and the two parameters the `enable_fib` which enables the fibonacci calculation and the `max_threshold` which is the maximum number the fibonacci action can/should perform.

| Input Name      | Description                                       | Default Value |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `enable_fib`  | Enables Fibonacci calculation (`true` or `false`) | `true`    |
| `max_threshold` | Maximum Fibonacci number that can be computed    | `100`   |

### 3. How It Works

* The action scans the PR for added or modified file content.
* It extracts all numerical values from the PR content.
* It computes the Fibonacci value for each number up to the `max_threshold`.
* It posts a comment on the PR with the extracted numbers and their Fibonacci values.

### 4. Example Comment Output

When a PR contains numbers, FibBot will post a comment like:

```
Extracted numbers: [5, 8, 12]
Fibonacci calculation results: [5, 21, 144]
```

- Special Thanks all my Tutor [MARC JAZZ](https://github.com/Marcjazz) for briefing us on want the project is expect to do so we don't succeed with a wrong task completed.
